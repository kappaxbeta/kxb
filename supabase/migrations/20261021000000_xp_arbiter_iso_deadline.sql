-- ============================================================================
-- A deadline JavaScript can read
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- `vote_open` wrote its deadline with `to_char(..., 'OF')`, which renders the
-- offset as `+00`. `Date.parse` returns NaN for that - ISO 8601 wants `+00:00` -
-- and both consequences were silent:
--
--   * the vote panel counted down from zero, from the instant it opened;
--   * the client that asks the server to close the vote parses the same string,
--     found NaN, and scheduled nothing - so a vote nobody answered stayed open
--     forever, which is exactly the hole 1fd2b18 was written to shut, reopened
--     through a different door.
--
-- Found by opening a vote in two real browsers and reading the panel. No test
-- in this repo could have: every one of them checks the *value* the function
-- returns, and the value was a correct timestamp in a format only Postgres and
-- a human can read.
--
-- `to_jsonb` on the timestamp gives ISO 8601 with a real offset, so there is no
-- format string left to get wrong.
